# Hi there, I'm Simran Vaz! 👋

## 🔒 Cybersecurity Professional in the Making

I'm a **Master's student in Cybersecurity** at Pace University, passionate about securing critical infrastructure and industrial control systems. I build tools and conduct research to understand and defend against emerging threats in OT/ICS environments.

### 🎯 What I'm Working On

- 🏭 **ICS Security Research** - Analyzing Modbus/TCP vulnerabilities and building detection systems
- 🛡️ **Threat Detection** - Developing automated anomaly detection for industrial networks
- 🔍 **Network Analysis** - Deep packet inspection and protocol security assessment
- 🐍 **Security Automation** - Python scripting for security operations and incident response

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

**Security:** Wireshark • Burp Suite • Metasploit • Nmap • Snort • Suricata  
**Programming:** Python • Bash • SQL  
**ICS/OT:** Modbus • SCADA • PLC/HMI Protocols  
**Analysis:** Scapy • Pandas • Network Traffic Analysis  
**Platforms:** Linux • Kali • SEEDLabs

### 🚀 Featured Projects

🔹 **[ICS Security Monitoring System](https://github.com/Similicious11/ics-security-monitoring)** - Automated threat detection for Modbus/TCP networks achieving 100% accuracy on critical attack scenarios

### 🌱 Currently Learning

- Advanced persistent threats (APT) in ICS environments
- SIEM integration and security orchestration
- Incident response for operational technology
- Cloud security and zero-trust architectures
